<p>Some similarities between python in scratch is the same way u can move around by going left and right and turning a certain amount of degrees.
 Some differences would be how in python you have to be more specific in making sure you have everything written correctly and having to use  terminal to get everrything to work.
 It was honstly very irritating to have to debug my program when something didn't work but it made me want to keep trying to make sure that I would get my program to run correctly.
 I liked having to actually type what I wanted to happen then how in scratch I had to drag and drop different functions. What was hard was making sure everything went the way I wanted
 like having to make sure I typed everything correctly.</p>
